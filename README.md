i created a variable that list about 20 frank sinatra's songs, then i set up a route using get method which will display any random songs listed the variable.
i created another route which display frank sinatra's date of birth using the same get method, then another route showing his birth city then a fourth one listing the names of his wives, then a fifth one displaying his picture in wikipedia.
